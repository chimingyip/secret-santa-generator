# secret-santa-generator
A quick Python program that generates a Secret Santa draw and emails the participants to tell them who they should get a gift for.
Works when sending from Gmail.

Roadmap:
- Add a UI (Django)
- Additional features such as gift budgets and christmas lists

Inspired by Lena Elizabeth Shapiro's secret santa project
